FaroVerse NFT Distribution

FaroVerse's vision is to enable brands to participate in Web3 and build long-term customer relationships and engagement. A key part of this vision is to enable distribution of brands' assets into marketplaces & platforms and mint them as NFTs. Our goal is to reduce the complexity for brands while still enabling them to reap the benefits of web3 presence. With FaroVerse, brands can leverage their non-Web3 assets by connecting their NFTs to the exclusive offers and promotions.  FaroVerse will be programmatically integrating with Web3 platforms to scale the number of brands and the number of NFTs that are participating in Web3.  By bringing diversity of assets, FaroVerse can potentially increase user engagement and monetization of Web3 platforms. 

Faroverse is just getting started. We are signing up to be developers on the Web3 platforms so we can have access to APIs to build our product. More to come as we make progress!
